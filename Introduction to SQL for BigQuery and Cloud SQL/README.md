# Introduction to SQL for BigQuery and Cloud SQL

## Overview
SQL (Structured Query Language) is a powerful language for managing and analyzing structured datasets. This lab serves as an introduction to SQL, designed to prepare you for future labs and quests in Google Cloud Skills Boost on data science topics. The lab is divided into two parts:

1. **SQL Fundamentals in BigQuery:** Learn essential SQL querying keywords using the BigQuery console on a public dataset containing information on London bikeshare.

2. **Working with Cloud SQL:** Explore exporting subsets of the London bikeshare dataset into CSV files, uploading them to Cloud Storage, and then using Cloud SQL to create and manage databases and tables.

## What You'll Learn
This lab will teach you how to:
- Distinguish between databases, tables, and projects.
- Construct simple queries using SELECT, FROM, and WHERE keywords.
- Navigate and utilize the BigQuery console efficiently.
- Load databases and tables into BigQuery.
- Execute basic queries and utilize keywords like COUNT, GROUP BY, AS, and ORDER BY.
- Export data subsets into CSV files and store them in Cloud Storage.
- Create a Cloud SQL instance, load exported CSV files, and run queries using SQL commands such as CREATE DATABASE, CREATE TABLE, DELETE, INSERT INTO, and UNION.

## Prerequisites
**Important:** Before starting the lab, log out of your personal or corporate Gmail account.

- This is an introductory-level lab, assuming little to no prior experience with SQL.
- Familiarity with Cloud Storage and Cloud Shell is recommended but not required.
- This lab will teach you the basics of SQL, focusing on reading and writing queries using BigQuery and Cloud SQL.

### Recommended Labs for Advanced Use Cases
Once you are comfortable with SQL basics, consider exploring more challenging labs to apply your knowledge to advanced use cases:

- [Weather Data in BigQuery](#)
- [Analyzing Natality Data Using Vertex AI and BigQuery](#)

### Task 3: More SQL Keywords
Explore advanced SQL keywords like GROUP BY, COUNT, AS, and ORDER BY to aggregate and organize query results effectively.

### Task 4: Working with Cloud SQL
Learn to export query results as CSV files. Discover Cloud SQL, a fully-managed database service, and export subsets of the dataset to CSV files.

### Task 5: Create a Cloud SQL Instance
Set up a Cloud SQL instance, configure it as a MySQL database, and select the appropriate specifications for your instance.
