# Set Up and Configure a Cloud Environment in Google Cloud


## Introduction

Welcome to the challenge lab for setting up and configuring a Cloud Environment in Google Cloud! In this hands-on lab, you will be faced with a scenario and a series of tasks. Instead of step-by-step instructions, your expertise gained from previous labs will be put to the test as you figure out how to complete the tasks on your own. An automated scoring system will provide real-time feedback on the correctness of your actions.

**Important Note:** To score 100%, you must successfully complete all tasks within the given time period.

This challenge is recommended for students who have previously completed labs in the "Set up and Configure a Cloud Environment in Google Cloud" quest. Are you ready to put your skills to the ultimate test?

## Setup

### Before You Start
- Read these instructions thoroughly as labs are timed, and there's no option to pause.
- The timer begins when you click "Start Lab," and it indicates how long Google Cloud resources will be available to you.
- This lab is hands-on, allowing you to perform activities in a real cloud environment with temporary credentials.

### Prerequisites
To complete this lab, ensure you have:
- Access to a standard internet browser (Google Chrome is recommended).

## Challenge Scenario

As a cloud engineer at Jooli Inc., recently trained in Google Cloud and Kubernetes, you've been enlisted to assist the Griffin team in setting up their environment. While the team has made some progress, they need your expertise to finalize the work.

### Tasks

1. Create a development VPC with three subnets manually.
2. Create a production VPC with three subnets manually.
3. Create a bastion that is connected to both VPCs.
4. Create a development Cloud SQL Instance and connect and prepare the WordPress environment.
5. Create a Kubernetes cluster in the development VPC for WordPress.
6. Prepare the Kubernetes cluster for the WordPress environment.
7. Create a WordPress deployment using the supplied configuration.
8. Enable monitoring of the cluster via Stackdriver.
9. Provide access for an additional engineer.

### Standards

Adhere to the following Jooli Inc. standards:
- Create all resources in the us-east4 region and us-east4-c zone unless otherwise directed.
- Use project VPCs.
- Follow the naming convention: team-resource (e.g., kraken-webserver1).
- Choose cost-effective resource sizes (e.g., unless directed, use e2-medium).

## Your Challenge

Your mission is to assist the Griffin team in their initial work on a new project involving WordPress. While some groundwork has been laid, your expert skills are required to address the remaining tasks. The team is counting on you, so as soon as you sit down at your desk and open your laptop, dive into the challenge, and good luck!

## `Lab Name` - *Set Up and Configure a Cloud Environment in Google Cloud: Challenge Lab [GSP321]*
## `Lab Link` - [Click Here](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/focuses/10603?parent=catalog)

* Run the below commands in the cloud shell terminal

```cmd
export USER_NAME2=
```

## Task 1. Create development VPC manually

```cmd
gcloud compute networks create griffin-dev-vpc --subnet-mode custom

gcloud compute networks subnets create griffin-dev-wp --network=griffin-dev-vpc --region us-east1 --range=192.168.16.0/20

gcloud compute networks subnets create griffin-dev-mgmt --network=griffin-dev-vpc --region us-east1 --range=192.168.32.0/20
```

## Task 2. Create production VPC manually

```cmd
gsutil cp -r gs://cloud-training/gsp321/dm .

cd dm

sed -i s/SET_REGION/us-east1/g prod-network.yaml

gcloud deployment-manager deployments create prod-network \
    --config=prod-network.yaml

cd ..
```

## Task 3. Create bastion host

```cmd
gcloud compute instances create bastion --network-interface=network=griffin-dev-vpc,subnet=griffin-dev-mgmt  --network-interface=network=griffin-prod-vpc,subnet=griffin-prod-mgmt --tags=ssh --zone=us-east1-b

gcloud compute firewall-rules create fw-ssh-dev --source-ranges=0.0.0.0/0 --target-tags ssh --allow=tcp:22 --network=griffin-dev-vpc

gcloud compute firewall-rules create fw-ssh-prod --source-ranges=0.0.0.0/0 --target-tags ssh --allow=tcp:22 --network=griffin-prod-vpc
```

## Task 4. Create and configure Cloud SQL Instance

```cmd
gcloud sql instances create griffin-dev-db --root-password password --region=us-east1 --database-version=MYSQL_5_7
```

```
gcloud sql connect griffin-dev-db
```

* For SQL PASSWORD - use `password`.

```
CREATE DATABASE wordpress;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON wordpress.* TO "wp_user"@"%" IDENTIFIED BY "stormwind_rules";
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

```
exit
```

## Task 5. Create Kubernetes cluster

* This will take approx 5-10 mins to create a Cluster, so be patience here.

```cmd
gcloud container clusters create griffin-dev \
  --network griffin-dev-vpc \
  --subnetwork griffin-dev-wp \
  --machine-type n1-standard-4 \
  --num-nodes 2  \
  --zone us-east1-b

gcloud container clusters get-credentials griffin-dev --zone us-east1-b

cd ~/

gsutil cp -r gs://cloud-training/gsp321/wp-k8s .
```
