# Cloud Monitoring: Qwik Start

## Overview
Cloud Monitoring empowers you with insights into the performance, uptime, and overall health of cloud-powered applications. It seamlessly collects metrics, events, and metadata from various sources, such as Google Cloud, Amazon Web Services, uptime probes, and popular application components like Cassandra, Nginx, Apache Web Server, Elasticsearch, and more. The data is ingested and transformed into actionable insights through intuitive dashboards, charts, and alerts. Cloud Monitoring integrates with collaboration tools like Slack, PagerDuty, HipChat, Campfire, fostering effective communication and incident resolution.

## Hands-on Lab
This hands-on lab guides you through monitoring a Compute Engine virtual machine (VM) instance with Cloud Monitoring. You'll also install monitoring and logging agents to gather additional information, including metrics and logs from third-party applications.

### Tasks:
1. **Create a Compute Engine instance:** Set up a virtual machine instance on Google Cloud to monitor.
2. **Add Apache2 HTTP Server:** Enhance your instance by adding the Apache2 HTTP Server.
3. **Create an uptime check:** Establish an uptime check to monitor the availability of your instance.
4. **Create an alerting policy:** Set up alerting policies to proactively respond to performance or uptime issues.
5. **Create a dashboard and chart:** Build a customized dashboard with insightful charts to visualize key metrics.
6. **View your logs:** Explore logs generated by your instance for deeper insights and troubleshooting.
7. **Check uptime check results and triggered alerts:** Validate the effectiveness of your monitoring setup by reviewing uptime check results and triggered alerts.
